  <div class="box">
    <p><b>Paduce</b> is not just an architect of buildings, but an architect of dreams and nightmares.</p>
    <p>Born from secret experiments in a futuristic lab, he wears a blue mask that covers his entire face, a worn blue hood, and a jacket marked with the word <i>‚ÄúPaduce‚Äù</i>.</p>
    <p>His purpose: to hunt nightmares and destroy them. He builds labyrinths and dreamscapes to trap them, navigating the dreamworld with the power of his mask.</p>
    <p>But his greatest enemy is a powerful woman with superpowers ‚Äî a nightmare that blurs the line between dream and reality.</p>
  </div>
  <p>He is both creator and destroyer. Savior and killer. A legend whispered about in the shadows of dreams.</p>
